## Check that the alternative Bezout bound always beats (or equals) the 
## naive BKK source bound for n=2,3,4,5 [Conjecture 5.10 and Remark 5.11]
## We don't need to check CRNs with only n+1 sources as in this case
## the solvability condition is linear giving an alternative Bezout bound
## of 1, which clearly cannot be improved on.
